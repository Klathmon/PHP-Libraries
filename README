My drop-in and use PHP Libraries. (Requires PHP >= 5.3)

To use it, put the 'Klathmon' folder inside your includes/library directory, and include the Loader.php file. That
file will take care of all the includes via an autoloader.

Everything inside the Packages folder is under the Klathmon namespace, sub-folders inside there have their own 
sub-namespaces. Loader.php supports unlimited depth (within reason) with sub-namespaces in the Packages directory.
